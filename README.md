### Week 4: Generic Stack ADT

#### Topics:

1. Sequential & Linked Implementations of Generic Stacks
2. Object-Oriented Programming & Inheritance
---

In week 4, we covered Java's native class hierarchy so that we could understand how inheritance and overriding work. We also covered several variations of the Stack ADT. See the slides in `slides/` and the code in `src/`. Also, see section 1.3 of the Algorithms text.
